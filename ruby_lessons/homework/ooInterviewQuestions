Give three different examples of inheritance. Write these class definitions and their inheritance relationships out in Ruby.

What is the difference (in your own words) between a local variable, an instance variable, and class variable.
	-instance: begins with '@' and is confined to that scope. Similar to 'self'
	-local: More of a standard variable. Consider it as a 'decleration'
	-class: variables that belong directly to the class.		


What is encapsulation?
	-packing data into a single component?

What is a private method?
	-Not accessible from outside of the object.

What is the difference between a class and an object? What is the difference between a class and an instance?
	-Classes are subclasses of objects.

What is "duck typing" in Ruby?
	-caring less about the class of a variable and more about what methods can be called on it

Describe "Polymorphism"
	-provision of a single interface to entities of different types...

What is a "base class", "sub-class", and "super class"?	
	-super class returns the parent class in the inheritence chain
	-subclasses represent an 'is a' relationship
	-base classes are used to define 'abstract' classes
